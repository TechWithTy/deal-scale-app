Credit / Usage-Limiting Models & Strategies

Below are models and tradeoffs:

Model	Description	Pros	Cons / Challenges
Credits (prepaid units)	Users purchase “credits” which are deducted when AI features are used.	Predictable revenue, easy to meter, users understand “I have X credits left.”	Need good UX for consumption, refund logic, complexity in tracking
Usage quota per period	Each plan has an AI quota (e.g. 10,000 tokens / requests per month). Overages blocked or charged extra.	Simple, transparent, easy to communicate	Users hitting limits may be frustrated; determining fair quotas is tricky
Overage / tiered overage	After exceeding quota, you allow usage but charge a higher per-unit rate.	Flexibility, smooth transitions	Risk of large bills; need clear alerts
Soft caps / throttling	Once usage nears or reaches a cap, slow responses, degrade quality, or queue requests.	Controls cost without abrupt service cutoffs	Complexity in dynamic throttling; user experience may suffer
Hybrid (flat + usage)	Combine base plan access plus usage credits / quotas for AI features.	Predictability + scalability	More complex billing and tracking
Outcome-based / per-task pricing	Charge credits for completed tasks or "value delivered" rather than raw calls.	Aligns payment with actual value	Harder to measure outcomes reliably, might be subjective

Monday.com recently introduced an AI credit model: they allocate a monthly AI credit pool, and tasks consume credits. If tasks fail or don't change state, credits are not consumed. They also allow overdraft / soft continuation (i.e. AI continues after credits run out) to avoid total cutoff.

How to Design & Implement Credit Usage Limits for Your Bot / AI Features

Here’s a design spec + example implementation plan:

Usage / Credit Metrics to Track

Decide on the units for which credits are consumed. Examples:

Prompt tokens processed (input + output token count)

Number of API calls / queries

Number of LLM responses / completions

Tasks completed (summaries, replies, automations, etc.)

Time taken / compute cost (e.g. GPU seconds)

For your GORT system, you might pick: “1 credit per 1,000 tokens processed” or “1 credit per chat reply generated.”

Schema / Tables

Add tables or columns to track usage and credit balances:

UserCredits {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  credit_balance BIGINT,  -- number of credits remaining
  credit_allocated BIGINT,  -- credits assigned this billing period
  credit_used BIGINT,       -- usage so far
  last_reset TIMESTAMP,     -- when credits were last reset
  expired_credits BIGINT    -- keep history
}

CreditUsageLog {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  group_id UUID REFERENCES groups(id) NULL,
  feature VARCHAR,          -- e.g. “LLM_reply”, “summarization”, etc.
  credits_consumed BIGINT,
  input_tokens BIGINT,
  output_tokens BIGINT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP
}


Also extend your Order / Billing schema so that credit purchases or top-ups are recorded:

CreditPurchase {
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  credits_bought BIGINT,
  price_cents INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
}

Credit Check / Deduction Logic

When a user triggers an AI feature:

Check if credit_balance >= cost_for_this_operation

If yes:

Deduct credits (credit_balance -= cost)

Log in CreditUsageLog

Proceed with the AI call

If no:

Depending on policy:

Reject / block the request (fail with “insufficient credits”)

Offer to top-up / purchase more credits

Enter soft mode: allow limited AI with degraded responses or delayed processing

Queue the request until next billing period

Periodic Reset & Renewal

At billing cycle boundary (e.g. first day of month), reset or refill credits:

credit_balance = credit_allocated

credit_used = 0

last_reset = now()

If some unused credits should expire (e.g. no carryover), you can drop them or roll them into expired_credits.

Alerts & Monitoring

When a user’s credit_balance falls below a threshold (e.g. < 10%), warn them (“You have 10 credits left, top up soon”)

Provide usage dashboard / UI showing how many credits used, what features cost what

Optionally, block new high-cost features when near exhaustion

Overages / Grace Mode

You may implement overage: allow usage beyond credits but charge extra credits or cash for them

Or grace mode: degrade quality (use simpler model / slower responses) instead of fully blocking

Or trial buffer: allow small negative credit balance up to a limit (e.g. −50 credits) before enforcement

Pricing & Credit Rates

Define mapping: e.g. 1,000 tokens = 1 credit, or 1 reply = 5 credits

Choose credit pack sizes: e.g. 100 credits, 500 credits, 1,000 credits

Decide cost per credit (e.g. $0.01 / credit or $10 / 1,000 credits)

Possibly implement volume discounts (buy more, cost per credit drops)

Edge Cases & Fail-Safes

If AI call fails or times out, refund credits (don’t penalize user)

If user cancels mid-flow, rollback deductions

Prevent race conditions (multiple concurrent feature calls) by locking or atomic operations on credit balance

Monitor unusual usage spikes (possible abuse)

Keep audit trail (CreditUsageLog) for dispute resolution

Example Usage Flow

User in group asks bot: “Summarize last 50 messages”

System calculates cost: e.g. 50,000 tokens → cost = 50 credits

Check credit_balance for that user (or group)

If enough credits → deduct 50, log usage, call AI API

Bot returns summary

If not enough credits → reply: “You have insufficient credits — top up?”

User tops up via your credit purchase API (e.g. Stripe payment), credits added, then user can continue.

Recommended Policy / Mix for Your Setup

Considering you have plans, commission, AI, you might want a hybrid subscription + credit model:

Each tier gives a base credit allocation (e.g. Basic = 100 credits / mo, Pro = 1,000 credits / mo, Enterprise = 10,000 credits / mo)

If they exceed, either block or overage charge (e.g. 2× credit cost)

Soft mode: allow continuation with limited quality (e.g. fallback to cheaper model)

Credits purchased separately (credit packs)

Use warnings / dashboard to prevent surprises

This hybrid approach is common in AI SaaS pricing models (flat + usage)

If you like, I can build the credit usage module code (in your backend stack, e.g. Node.js or Python) + APIs + sample front-end UI for top-ups and warnings. Want me to generate that now?
