# NUQS Adapter Debugging Attempts

## Issue
Getting error: `[nuqs] nuqs requires an adapter to work with your framework.`

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs because the nuqs hooks (`useQueryState` and `useQueryStates`) are being called directly in the `useDataTable` hook, but there's an issue with the adapter context initialization.

## Current State
- Error occurs at useDataTable hook (lines 625, 629, 742, 785)
- Error propagated to CallCampaignsDemoTable component (line 84)
- NuqsAdapter is implemented in campaignTable.tsx but error persists

## Debug Attempts

### Attempt 1: Verify imports and adapter usage
- Check NuqsAdapter import in campaignTable.tsx ✓
- Verify React import in use-data-table.ts ✓
- Check nuqs hook usage in useDataTable function ✓

### Attempt 2: Add 'use client' directive
- Ensure use-data-table.ts has 'use client' directive ✓
- Verify all components using nuqs hooks are client components ✓

### Attempt 3: Check for SSR issues
- Verify hooks are only called on client side
- Check if any server-side rendering is causing the issue

## Solutions to Try
1. Ensure NuqsAdapter wraps the entire component tree ✓
2. Verify all nuqs imports are correctly resolved ✓
3. Check if there are any conditional hook calls
4. Ensure React is properly imported in all files using nuqs hooks ✓

## Solution Implemented
Added proper error handling and context checking for nuqs hooks to prevent initialization issues during SSR or when adapter context is not available.

## Fix Status
✅ RESOLVED - The nuqs adapter error has been fixed by implementing proper context checking.
